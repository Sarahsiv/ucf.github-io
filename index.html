    <h2>Project Description</h2>
    <p>
        This project is a working prototype of a real-time control system modeled after technology used in advanced aircraft simulators. Built on an ESP32 microcontroller and simulated entirely in Wokwi, the system demonstrates how modern aerospace hardware reacts instantly to pilot inputs, monitors critical sensors, and responds safely under tight timing constraints.
    </p>
    <p>
        The prototype collects live sensor data, processes flight-control calculations, responds to emergency inputs, and transmits telemetry—while guaranteeing that high-priority safety tasks always meet their deadlines. Multiple LEDs, a button, and a software-driven flight-stick input are used to visualize how the system behaves in real time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Although simplified, the design mirrors the structure of actual aerospace control software: interrupt-driven reaction to pilot actions, strict periodic sensor sampling, prioritized task scheduling, and deterministic behavior that engineers can validate with precise timing logs. This proof-of-concept shows that the system can reliably maintain safe operation even under heavy load, making it suitable as an early milestone for a flight-simulation or defense-technology project.
